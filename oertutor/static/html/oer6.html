Binary numbers and arithmetic let you represent any amount you want using just two digits: 0 and 1. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Decimal 1 is binary 0001<br />
Decimal 3 is binary 0011<br />
Decimal 6 is binary 0110<br />
Decimal 9 is binary 1001<br />
<br />
Each digit "1" in a binary number represents a power of two, and each "0" represents zero:<br />
<br />
0001 is 2 to the zero power, or 1<br />
0010 is 2 to the 1st power, or 2<br />
0100 is 2 to the 2nd power, or 4<br />
1000 is 2 to the 3rd power, or 8.<br />
When you see a number like "0101" you can figure out what it means by adding the powers of 2:<br />
<br />
0101 = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5<br />
1010 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10<br />
0111 = 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 7<br />
