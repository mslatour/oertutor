    Introduction
</H3>
In mathematics, inclusive OR is given preference to exclusive OR (also
called XOR).

For example, when you write <B>p V q</B> which is read "p OR q", this
is inclusive OR.  This statement is true when p is true, or q is true,
or both p and q is true.  Inclusive OR is used as the default meaning
of OR, and works more often in logic than exclusive OR.

We often see XOR used in sentences.  For example, if someone says
"This summer, I am going to London, or I am going to Paris", they seem
to suggest that they plan to go to one or the other, but not both.
Even though their statement wouldn't be considered wrong if they
went to both cities, it suggests very strongly that they intend
to go to one city.  (Of course, in logic, it's hard to convey the
notion "suggests very strongly").

You would think XOR wouldn't be that interesting an operator.
It's similar to OR, so why should it be any more interesting than
OR?

But it is!
<H3>
    Various Views of XOR
</H3>
You can think of XOR in many ways.  Assume that <B>p</B> and
<B>q</B> are Boolean variables.  Also assume that <B>p<sub>1</sub>,
    p<sub>2</sub>, ...p<sub>n</sub></B> are Boolean variables.  Let (+) be
the XOR operator (this is a circle with a plus sign inside it).  In
this case, we assume that <B>p</B> and <B>q</B> are boolean values,
instead of words, and we assume (+) is plain XOR, not bitwise XOR.
Later on, we'll use it as bitwise XOR.

<UL type=disc>
    <LI>
    <B>p (+) q</B> is true if exactly one of <B>p</B> and <B>q</B> is
    true.  This is the conventional definition of XOR.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    <B>p<sub>1</sub> (+) p<sub>2</sub> (+) ... (+) p<sub>n</sub></B> is true 
    if the number of variables with the value true is odd (and is false
    if the number of variables with the value true is even).  Notice this
    definition ignores the variables which are assigned to false.

    This may seem like an odd view of XOR.  (No pun intended). However,
    if you believe that XOR is associative (which it is), it's merely an
    extension of the first definition of XOR.

    This definition makes sense, if you read the next definition.
    </LI>
    <LI>
    <B>p<sub>1</sub> (+) p<sub>2</sub> (+) ... (+) p<sub>n</sub></B> is the
    same as adding modulo 2.  If <B>p<sub>i</sub></b> is true, then
    treat it as a 1, otherwise treat it as a 0.   Then, XOR operation
    is equivalent to:
    <PRE>
     p<sub>1</sub> (+) p<sub>2</sub> (+) ... (+) p<sub>n</sub> == ( p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub> + ... + p<sub>n</sub> ) % 2
    </PRE>
    Thus, XOR applied to a bunch of Boolean variables is the same as summing
    up all the variables' values (where true is 1 and false is 0), and dividing
    mod 2.  Recall that dividing mod 2 is one way to determine if a number
    is even or odd.  Since only the variables that have value 1 contribute
    to the sum (0 is the identity value in sums), this determines how many
    variables have value 1.
    </LI>
</UL>
<H4>
    Parity Check
</H4>
People often use XOR as a means of doing a <I>parity check</I>.
A bitstring has even parity if the number of 1's in the string is
even.  It has an odd parity if the number of 1's is odd.  If you
XOR the bits together, you can tell whether a bitstring has even
or odd parity.

This can often be used to verify data sent across a network,
where there's some probability a bit may be corrupted.   For example,
suppose you're sending N bytes across the network from a source
location to a destination location.

How can you determine whether the bytes were sent correctly?
One way is to use a kind of checksum, which uses XOR.   Each byte
can be written as <B>b<sub>7</sub>b<sub>6</sub>...b<sub>0</sub></B>.
For each byte, XOR all the bits in position <B>b<sub>i</sub></B>.

If N was 10, and you're transmitting 10 bytes, then create an 11th
byte where <B>b<sub>i</sub></B> is the XOR of all 10 bytes
i<sup>th</sup> bit.  This 11th byte is called the <I>checksum</I>.
This checksum is also sent across the network.

At the destination end, where the data is being received, you
can then independently perform the checksum again, and see if the
checksum you performed matches the checksum sent across.  If so,
then you have some confidence that no bytes were corrupted.  If
it's not the same, then the network has corrupted some bytes,
and you may need to retransmit the data.

Clearly the system could have errors.  For example, if two
bits were flipped, say, bit 3 of bytes 4 and 5, then the checksum
would be the same if they hadn't been flipped, but there would
still be errors.   Nevertheless, it catches some errors.
<H3>
    Properties of XOR
</H3>
Here are several useful properties of XOR.  This applies to plain XOR
and bitwise XOR.

<UL type=disc>
    <LI> <B>x (+) 0 = x</B> 

    XORing with 0 gives you back the same number.  Thus, 0 is the identity
    for XOR.

    </LI>
    <LI> <B>x (+) 1 = \x</B> 

    XORing with 1 gives you back the negation of the bit. Again, this
    comes from the truth table. For bitwise XOR, the property is slightly
    different: <B>x ^ ~0 = ~x</B> .  That is, if you XOR with all 1's, the
    result will be the bitwise negation of <B>x</B>.

    </LI>
    <LI> <B>x (+) x = 0</B> 

    XORing x with itself gives you 0.  That's because <B>x</B> is either
    0 or 1, and <B>0 (+) 0 = 0</B> and <B>1 (+) 1 = 0</B>.

    </LI>
    <LI> XOR is associative.  

    That is: <B>(x (+) y) (+) z = x (+) (y (+) z)</B>.
    You can verify this by using truth tables.
    </LI>
    <LI> XOR is commutative.
    That is: <B>x (+) y = y (+) x</B>.
    You can verify this by using truth tables.
</UL>

<H3>
    Bitwise XOR
</H3>
The properties of XOR apply to bitwise XOR.  Suppose <B>x</B> and <B>y</B>
are 32 bit words.   Then, <B>x ^ y</B> is basically like performing 32
XORs in parallel on an array of 32 booleans.

<H3>
    Swapping without "temp"
</H3>
Here's one of those brain-teasers that you can give to your
CS friends.  One of the classic problems any CS major should
be able to solve is writing code to swap two numbers.  Here's
how it looks in C.
<PRE>
  temp = x ;
  x = y ;
  y = temp ;
</PRE>
To swap, you introduce a "temp" variable.  Its name doesn't have
to be "temp", but it is nevertheless an additional temporary variable.
Now ask your friend to solve this without using a temp variable.
This means you can ONLY use <B>x</B> and <B>y</B>.  This does NOT
mean that you name the variable <B>temp2</B>.
How can you do this?  If you're thinking "perhaps I can use
bitwise XOR", you're right!   If you're adventuresome, you can
think about how to do this on your own, but if not, here's the 
answer.
<PRE>
  x = x ^ y ;
  y = x ^ y ;
  x = x ^ y ;
</PRE>

Are you convinced this works?   Perhaps not.   How could
you be convinced this works?

The key to convincing yourself this works is to keep track of the
original value of <B>x</B> and <B>y</B>.  Let <B>A</B> be the
original value of <B>x</B> (that is, the value <B>x</B> has just
before running these three lines of code).  Similarly, let <B>B</B>
be the original value of <B>y</B>.

We can comment each line of code to see what's happening.

<PRE>
// x == A, y == B
x = x ^ y ;  
// x == A ^ B, y == B
y = x ^ y ;  
// x == A ^ B
// y == (A ^ B) ^ B == A ^ (B ^ B)  (by Assoc)
//   == A ^ 0  (by z ^ z == 0 property)
//   == A      (by z ^ 0 == z property)
x = x ^ y ;
// x == ( A ^ B ) ^ A
//   == ( A ^ A ) ^ B  (by Assoc/Commutativity)
//   == 0 ^ B            (by z ^ z == 0 property)
//   == B                (by z ^ 0 == z property)
// y == A
</PRE>
After the second statement has executed, <B>y = A</B>.  After
the third statement, <B>x = B</B>.

Now it turns out you can do a similar trick using subtraction
instead of XOR.  Doing swaps with XOR is slightly safer than
swapping with subtraction because subtraction can cause overflow.
However, usually overflow occurs in a "nice way" that it may still
work.  Overflow often just "wraps around", so things may still work
out fine.
<H3>
    Writing bitwise XOR without ^
</H3>
Suppose you wanted to implement bitwise XOR, but didn't have
^ operator.  What would you do?   With bitwise AND (&)
and bitwise OR (|), you can do this.
<PRE>
  x ^ y == (~x & y) | (x & ~y)
</PRE>
This is the standard definition of XOR as defined in logic books,
applied to bitwise operations.
<H3>
    Summary
</H3>
XOR is an interesting operation.  With it, you can do parity
checks and swaps without temp variables.
