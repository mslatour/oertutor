		A binary number is expressed in a system of numerical notation to the base 2, in which
		each place of a number, expressed as 0 or 1, corresponds to a power of 2.
		The decimal number 58 appears as 111010 in binary notation, since 58 = 1 &times;
		2<sup>5</sup> + 1 &times; 2<sup>4</sup> + 1 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> + 0
		&times; 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 &times; 2<span>1</span> + 0 &times; 2<span>0</span>.
