	In simple situations such as three nonempty stacks of which two are identical, there
	is an easy strategy: take away all objects from the stack that is
	different. The intuition is that when the opponent is confronted with a
	situation where there are only two identical stacks left, he can either
	pick everything from a stack (leaving you a winning situation) or pick only
	a part of it (leaving you a situation where you can created two identical
	stacks again).
